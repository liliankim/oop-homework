## Overview
​
### The challenge

This weeks challenge was to build a command line application using node to generate a html webpage.
​
### User Story

Build a webpage to generate a team profile using the command line and then displaying all of that information in the html webpage.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
-use inquirer package
-html webpage to display
-command line interface in node to be utilized


## My process
I firs stareted with calling all the necessary packages and then building the index.js. Afterwards the library was created for each job role and then tests were created and run. Afterwards Cards were written so that the html and javascript could be pulled making a dynamic webpage.
### Built with
​
- HTML
- CSS
-javascript
-node
-bootstrap
​

​
### What I learned
​
I learned how much I needed to brush up on my css, html and javascript! 
Doing the tests was also very intriguing to see and I learned that I really enjoy the testing aspect of the OOP homework.
Besides console logging, I learned that we are able to actually write in and test our codes directly to make sure that they are working.
​
### Continued development
​
TO continue development, I would like to be able to work on testing more functions.
​

### Useful resources
bootstrap
